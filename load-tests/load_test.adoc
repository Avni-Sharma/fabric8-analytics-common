= Load tests

The scripts listed in the sections below help perform a load test.

== Invoking the load test
. Fire the load in any of the following two ways:

* To simulate almost simultaneous workload use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-futures/0.9.0[future-requests] as follows:
+
`./run_load_test.py <concurrent request count> <API URL>`
+
* To generate the load use the http://locust.io[locust] framework as follows:
+
`locust -f locust-test.py --host=<HOST URL>`
. Invoke the load
test from http://localhost:8089


== Monitoring the load test

Use the `monitor_load_test.sh` script to monitor the database entry that gets
created as part of the load test as follows:
----
./monitor_load_test.sh <2 *
concurrent request count>
----
NOTE: Do not run the monitor script against Staging or Production as it truncates the tables once the tests are performed.
